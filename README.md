# dialogue-graph

Implementation of neural dialogue generator architecture with pre-trained transformer models, which leverage an external knowledge-graph for enhanced factual accuracy. The details of this project is presented in [thesis.pdf](https://github.com/Mrpatekful/dialogue-graph/blob/main/thesis.pdf). A working example and the source code of the implementation is going to be uploaded soon as well.
